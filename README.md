# Roblox-Fighting-Game
A fighting game project that I did for my college capstone course.
Won't run properly as is due to roblox game copy protection.
Here's a link to the game if you wanna try it out, it's basically just a Tech Demo though: https://www.roblox.com/games/71283352209025/Fighting-Game-Project.
I also put all the necessary assets to make the game run on your own, but it would take some work implementing them.
The .rbxm files are basically frame data for the animations. 
If you drag the .rbxm files into the game workspace and save them to your roblox account they can be used as animations, which is what roblox is otherwise trying to prevent.
